version: 2.1 # Use version 2.1 to enable orb usage.

orbs:
  win: circleci/windows@2.2.0 # The Windows orb give you everything you need to start using the Windows executor.

jobs:
  build: # name of your job
    executor:
      name: win/default # executor type
      size: "medium" # resource class, can be "medium", "large", "xlarge", "2xlarge", defaults to "medium" if not specified

    steps:
      # Commands are run in a Windows virtual machine environment
      - checkout
      - run: Write-Host 'Hello, Windows'
      - run: npm install

# # Use the latest 2.1 version of CircleCI pipeline process engine. 
# # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference
# version: 2.1

# orbs:
#   # The Node.js orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can utilize
#   # Orbs reduce the amount of configuration required for common tasks. 
#   # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node
#   node: circleci/node@4.1


# jobs:
#   # Below is the definition of your job to build and test your app, you can rename and customize it as you want.
#   build-and-test:  
#     # These next lines define a Docker executor: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
#     # You can specify an image from Dockerhub or use one of our Convenience Images from CircleCI's Developer Hub.
#     # A list of available CircleCI Docker Convenience Images are available here: https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/node
#     docker:
#       - image: cimg/node:15.1
#     # Then run your tests!
#     # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
#     steps:
#       # Checkout the code as the first step.
#       - checkout
#       # Next, the node orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a package.json.
#       # The orb install-packages step will also automatically cache them for faster future runs.
#       - node/install-packages
#       # If you are using yarn instead npm, remove the line above and uncomment the two lines below.
#       # - node/install-packages:
#       #     pkg-manager: yarn 
#       - run:
#           name: Run tests
#           command: npm test

# workflows:
#   # Below is the definition of your workflow.
#   # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
#   # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.
#   # For more details on extending your workflow, see the configuration docs: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
#   sample: 
#     jobs:
#       - build-and-test
#       # For running simple node tests, you could optionally use the node/test job from the orb to replicate and replace the job above in fewer lines.
#       # - node/test
